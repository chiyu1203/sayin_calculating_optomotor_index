Calculating optomotor index of tethered locusts

This repository contains a jupyter notebook used to quantify the optomotor responses of individual locusts in response to moving dots, as described in [Sayin et al., Placeholder Year].

Locusts were tethered on an airball, watching different numbers of dots moving across the screen. Animal tracking was done by [fictrac](https://github.com/rjdmoore/fictrac) and visual stimuli were delivered using [BonVision](https://bonvision.github.io/) on [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/).

We defined an optomotor index to quantify optomotor walking behaviour as the net angular velocities along yaw axis (clockwises and counterclockwise) for a given trial, normalised by the sum of the absolute value of the angular velocities. 

For details, please refer to [Sayin et al. Placeholder Year], and Seelig et al., 2010.
