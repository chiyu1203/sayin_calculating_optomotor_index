Calculating optomotor index of tethered locusts

This repository contains a jupyter notebook used to quantify the optomotor responses of individual locusts in response to moving dots, as described in [Sayin et al., Placeholder Year].

Locusts were tethered on a airball, wathcing dots moving clockwise or counterclockwise. Animal tracking was done by [fictrac](https://github.com/rjdmoore/fictrac) and visual stimuli were delivered using [BonVision](https://bonvision.github.io/) on [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/).
